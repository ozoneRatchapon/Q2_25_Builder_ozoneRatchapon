# Project Overview: My Awesome Journey Through the Turbine Builder Cohort! 🚀

This project is a showcase of my learning journey through the Turbine Builder Cohort! 🎉 It highlights the skills and knowledge I've picked up along the way. It's made up of several submodules, each diving into different parts of blockchain and Solana development. Check out the overview below to see how each submodule connects to the Turbine Builder Cohort curriculum. 👇

## Submodules

### [Turbin3-Pre-requisite-ts](https://github.com/ozoneRatchapon/Turbin3-Pre-requisite-ts)
This submodule is all about TypeScript and core Solana stuff! 💻 It shows I get how to:
- Use JavaScript tools to work with Solana.
- Handle keypairs like a pro.
- Airdrop and transfer those sweet SOL tokens. 💸
- Enroll in a dApp.
- This was my starting point, getting comfy with the basics of Solana using TypeScript.

### [Turbin3-Pre-requisite-rs](https://github.com/ozoneRatchapon/Turbin3-Pre-requisite-rs)
Here's the Rust version, doing the same things as the TypeScript one! 🦀 It proves I can:
- Do the same things in different languages, showing I'm flexible.
- Understand when to use Rust or TypeScript for Solana projects. 🤔
- Solidify my understanding of core Solana concepts by implementing them in Rust after learning them in TypeScript.

### [solana-starter](https://github.com/ozoneRatchapon/solana-starter)
This submodule documents my journey through building Web3 applications on Solana. It showcases various implementations from basic wallet interactions to more complex operations with SPL tokens and NFTs. It demonstrates my understanding of:
- Creating SPL Tokens with customizable parameters, minting, and transferring them.
- Adding metadata to tokens, enhancing their on-chain representation.
- Implementing the full NFT minting process, including image upload to Irys (formerly Bundlr) and metadata creation following Metaplex standards.
- Interacting with the WBA Vault Program, including setting up vault storage and managing SOL, SPL tokens, and NFTs.

### [anchor-vault](https://github.com/ozoneRatchapon/anchor-vault)
This is the Solana Vault Program, built with Anchor! ⚓ It lets users:
- Start a vault.
- Put in funds.
- Take out funds.
- Close the vault.
This proves I can:
- Build secure smart contracts using Anchor.
- Implement key vault features on Solana.

### [anchor-escrow](https://github.com/ozoneRatchapon/anchor-escrow)
This submodule is the Solana Escrow Program, also using Anchor! 🤝 It lets users:
- Create and manage escrow transactions.
- Make, take, and refund escrows.
This shows I can:
- Build secure smart contracts with Anchor.
- Implement complex logic on the Solana blockchain.
- Use escrow principles in a decentralized world.

### [amm](https://github.com/ozoneRatchapon/amm)
This submodule implements an Automated Market Maker (AMM) on Solana! 💱 It demonstrates my understanding of:
- Decentralized exchange mechanisms.
- Liquidity pool management.
- Token swapping logic.

### [marketplace](https://github.com/ozoneRatchapon/marketplace)
This submodule provides a basic framework for creating a decentralized marketplace on Solana! 🛒 It showcases my ability to:
- Handle listing and purchasing of assets.
- Implement secure payment processing.
- Manage user interactions in a decentralized setting.

### [staking](https://github.com/ozoneRatchapon/staking)
This submodule implements a staking program on Solana! 🥩 It demonstrates my knowledge of:
- Staking mechanisms and rewards distribution.
- Secure handling of staked assets.
- Implementing time-based logic in smart contracts.

### [dice](https://github.com/ozoneRatchapon/dice)
This submodule implements a simple dice game on Solana! 🎲 It showcases my ability to:
- Generate verifiable randomness on-chain.
- Manage game logic and payouts.
- Create engaging decentralized applications.

### [anchor-vote](https://github.com/ozoneRatchapon/anchor-vote)
This submodule implements a voting program on Solana, built with Anchor! 🗳️ It demonstrates my understanding of:
- On-chain voting mechanisms.
- Governance and decision-making processes.
- Secure handling of votes and tallies.
- Voting capability with quadratic funding mechanics.

### [water-conservation-capstone-project](https://github.com/ozoneRatchapon/water-conservation)
This submodule is the grand finale! 🎓 It puts everything together and shows how the whole project works. It proves I can:
- Use what I've learned to build a real application.
- Combine different parts into one working system.
- Solve real problems using blockchain tech.
    - Greenmove is a Solana-based protocol designed to incentivize water conservation by rewarding users with points that can be redeemed at local businesses.
    - The protocol leverages DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) to obtain accurate water usage data, creating a transparent and verifiable system for tracking and rewarding conservation efforts.
    * Promotes environmental sustainability by encouraging water conservation.
    * Supports local economies by driving customers to participating businesses.
    * Provides tangible benefits to users for their eco-conscious behavior.
    * Creates a community-driven approach to resource management.
